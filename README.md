# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">

My name is Josua Blejeru, I'm 23 years old living in Nürnberg, Germany.

🔭 At my Dayjob I focus on DevOps, Cloud, Architecture and Data Engineering.

I have a huge passion for CNC Machining and 3D printing and can not wait to talk to other people about it 🙈.
Most of my time after work is spend on learning new things in the Technology sector and beyond, as well as going to Conferences, Barcamps and Meetups! 🥳
My only nontech hobby/passion is playing Guitar and Piano 😅.
